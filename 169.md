# Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

## Problem
Find the majority element (appears > n/2 times) in an array.

## Algorithm
Maintain a `candidate` and `count`:
1. If `count == 0`, set current element as candidate
2. If current element equals candidate, increment count
3. Otherwise, decrement count
4. Return the final candidate

## Why It Works
Think of it as elements "battling" each other. Each majority element occurrence cancels one non-majority occurrence. Since the majority element appears > n/2 times, it survives all cancellations.

## Example: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
```
Index 0: num=2 → candidate=2, count=1
Index 1: num=2 → candidate=2, count=2
Index 2: num=1 → candidate=2, count=1  (decrement)
Index 3: num=1 → candidate=2, count=0  (decrement)
Index 4: num=1 → candidate=1, count=1  (reset)
Index 5: num=2 → candidate=1, count=0  (decrement)
Index 6: num=2 → candidate=2, count=1  (reset)

Result: 2
```

## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n) - single pass
- **Space:** O(1) - only two variables

## Key Insight
The majority element will always remain as the final candidate because it outnumbers all other elements combined.
